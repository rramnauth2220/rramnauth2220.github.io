				<h3>Robots as tools for understanding human behavior.</h3>
				<p>
					I build theories about how people think, learn, and interact with the world around them
					[<a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10354177" target="_blank">HRI'22</a>,
					<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3611658" target="_blank">THRI'23</a>,
					<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10731350" target="_blank">RO-MAN'24</a>].
					Then, I apply these theories to develop robot-assisted interventions to better support users of various
					cognitive and technical abilities
					[<a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10354177" target="_blank">HRI'22</a>,
					<a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10248915" target="_blank">HRI'21</a>,
					<a href="https://scazlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/hri-frp1371.pdf" target="_blank">HRI'25</a>].
				</p>
				<p>Such theories include a theoretical framework for discerning socially appropriate robotic assistance,
					robot-assisted social skills interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder, long-term mental health support for
					caregivers of and individuals with dementia, a teleoperated robot platform for mitigating social isolation during the
					COVID-19 pandemic, designing robotic environments for social-emotional regulation for NYC public schools,
					and building custom social robots for anxiety reduction on university campuses.</p>

				<h3>Designing Deep-Breathing Robots</h3>
				<p>A core theme of my research is to design systems that support social and mental well-being in clinically
					meaningful way. I am working to develop custom robots like <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9900638/">Ommie</a> to support anxiety reduction in users as young as
					pre-school-age to seniors with dementia. By mimicking the rhythm of deep breaths through mechanical
					movements, Ommie provides tactile feedback and a calming social presence.</p>
				<p>For instructions on building your own Ommie, we are currently working on making its documentation and code open-source
					 [<em>coming Sept. 2025</em>].</p>

				<h3>Long-Term, In-Home Social Robots for Autism</h3>
				<p>Another branch of my research explores how robots can aid in diagnosing, treating, and understanding social disorders such as ADHD, OCD, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our focus is on developing long-term, in-home robot-assisted interventions while emphasizing the predictive role of behavioral markers and the clinical significance of these approaches. Key challenges include creating automated assessments in dynamic home environments, ensuring the long-term reliability of robots for daily use, and bridging the gap between research and clinical application. Our work highlights the potential of robots as effective, long-term tools for autism therapy, providing reliable in-home support.

				<h3>Robot-Assisted Therapy for Adults with Autism</h3>
				<p>
					Leveraging our previous successes in the development of socially assistive robots for ASD
					interventions [<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.aat7544"
						target="_blank">HRI'22</a>, <a href="https://scazlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/hri-frp1371.pdf" target="_blank">HRI'25</a>],
					we developed the Interruption Skill Training and Assessment Robot (ISTAR), an in-home autonomous
					training system	that helps adults with ASD to practice handling workplace-relevant interruptions [<a
						href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10354177" target="_blank">2</a>, <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvklVzbAOOc" target="_blank">3</a>]. ISTAR is rigorously
					evaluated by surveys of employers and adults with ASD, and a week-long study in the homes of adults with ASD
					during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the first in-home robot-assisted intervention for adults with ASD.

				<h3>Fighting Social Isolation During COVID-19</h3>
				<p>
					One facet of my research focuses on creating robust systems capable of autonomous operation in
					dynamic, unstructured settings like homes. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted several opportunities in our
					daily lives	for which robots can play a social role [<a
						href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.abc9014" target="_blank">4</a>].
				</p>
				<p>
					In response, we developed a robot teleoperation system tailored for elementary school-aged children,
					allowing them to engage in physical play even when physically separated [<a
						href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10248915" target="_blank">5</a>]. This approach empowers
					children to control the actions of robots
					in their friends' homes and communicate with them. The outcomes of our research, along with user
					feedback, suggest that robots can offer a fun
					and safe means for individuals to connect socially during a global pandemic. For more information
					about this project, visit <a href="https://robotsforgood.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Robots for
						Good.</a>

										  <h3>AI For Future Presidents</h3>
										<p>
											The rapid and nearly pervasive impact of AI on fields as diverse as medicine, law, banking, and the arts has made
											many students who would never enroll in a computer science class become interested in understanding elements of
											AI. Fueled by questions about how AI would change their own fields, these students
											are not seeking to become experts in building AI systems but instead are searching for a sufficient understanding to
											be safe, effective, and informed users. CS170 aims to encourage critical thinking about AI and its relevance for non-CS majors, without technical prerequisites [E-AAAI'25]. </p>
